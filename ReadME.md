# Mohit Kharel - Professional Portfolio Website

This is a clean, dynamic, and responsive single-page portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. All project, skill, and experience information is loaded from a single JavaScript file, making it easy to update and maintain without altering the website's structure.

3.  **Deploy:** GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. You can access it at `https://your-username.github.io`.
